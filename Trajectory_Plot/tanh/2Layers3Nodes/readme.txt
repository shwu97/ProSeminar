The three .csv documents are the trajectory of three different initial points obtained from 
MPC, with them the trajectory simulated by NN can be compared.

Conduct the trajectory_time.m to compare the trajectory of each state controlled by MPC and NN.
Conduct the phase_portrait.m to plot the phase portrait.
